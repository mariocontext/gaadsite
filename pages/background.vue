        <h1>Global Accessibility Awareness Day Background</h1>
            <p>The idea of a Global Accessibility Awareness Day started with a single <a href="http://mysqltalk.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/challenge-accessibility-know-how-needs-to-go-mainstream-with-developers-now/">blog post</a> written by a Los Angeles-based web developer, <a rel="author" href="joe_devon.php">Joe Devon</a>. <a rel="author" href="http://www.jennison.ca">Jennison Asuncion</a>, an accessibility professional from Toronto discovered Joeâ€™s blog post purely by accident thanks to randomly coming across this <a href="https://twitter.com/joedevon/status/140592581728944128">tweet</a> from Joe. After reading it, he immediately contacted Joe and they joined forces, leveraging their extensive and respective networks to realize the event.</p>

            <p>Starting in 2015, rather than using a fixed date, we invite you to help us mark GAAD on the third Thursday of May.</p>
